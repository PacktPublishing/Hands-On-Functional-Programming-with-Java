# Hands-On Functional Programming with Java [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Functional Programming with Java [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-functional-programming-java-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789804362), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Functional programming, a popular programming paradigm used to simplify many tasks, will help you write flexible and succinct code. This paradigm makes programs easier to reason with because they're deterministic (one specific input will always give you the same output).
This course takes a thought-leadership approach, gently introduces you to Functional Programming, and takes you all the way to becoming a master of the paradigm. You'll then learn how to work with higher-order functions, lambda functions, collections and more. You'll learn how to apply the best data structures and algorithms that optimize functions and also how to reuse and refactor functional blocks of code. This course is updated to Java 12 so that you will be ahead of the crowd. 
By the end of the course, you will have mastered the concepts regarding functional programming along with OOP, to build robust and highly testable applications.
